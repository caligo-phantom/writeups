## Problem Description
I've hidden a flag in this file. Can you find it? [Forensics is fun.pptm](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/c00c449c3b08daaccacca6f9d5c55d49/Forensics%20is%20fun.pptm)
## Approach
When I performed `binwalk "Forensics is fun.pptm"`I saw there's a bunch of .zip files. I extracted it using binwalk -e "Forensics is fun.pptm".<br>
Inside the extracted folder the text inside '/Downloads/ppt/slideMasters/hidden' stood out to me.
```

```
Decoding the above script at [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) using 'From Base64' I was able to discover the flag.
