# DockREleakage
## Category

## Problem Description
A breach occurred and some files have been leaked. One of the leaked files named dockREleakage.tar.gz contains an image of one of the company's components. An anonymous hacker has reached out to me and beware me that there is some serious mistake in my build image process. The hacker implies that sensitive information should be handled carefully. However, I couldn't find the mistake by myself. Please help me!
## Approach
In **dockREleakage.tar.gz** I found **flag.txt** with text:

```
73c73d_w17h1n_7h3_d0ck3rf1l3}
Find the rest of the flag by yourself!
```

It is evident what the flag is.
## Flag
flag{pr073c73d_w17h1n_7h3_d0ck3rf1l3}
